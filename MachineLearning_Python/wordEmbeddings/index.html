<h3>PAQ8</h3>

<p>PAQ8 is a series of archivers that achieve very high compression rates
at the expense of speed and memory. My latest version is
<a href=paq8l.zip>paq8l</a>, Mar. 8, 2007. I am no longer maintaining
this code. However, there have been many compression improvements
since then written by others, as described in the history section below.
Recent version can be found <a href=http://dhost.info/paq8/>here</a>.

<pre>
  To compress:   paq8l -5 archive [files_or_folders...]  (creates archive.paq8p)
  To decompress: paq8l -d archive.paq8l [output_folder]
</pre>
The -5 option is the default.  It requires 233 MB of memory for compression and
same for decompression.  Options may range from -1 (35 MB) to -8 (1712 MB).
More memory usually means better compression.
In the Windows version you can also compress or decompress by putting paq8l.exe on the
desktop and dropping files or folders on it.  Compressed files/folders have a .paq8l
extension.  The input is not deleted.

<p>NOTE: Files can only be decompressed with the same version of PAQ that
they were compressed with.  However, links to all versions can be found here.
Decompression requires the same memory and time as compression.

<p>All PAQ compressors use a context mixing algorithm described in
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAQ>Wikipedia</a>.
A large number of models independently predict the next bit of input.
The predictions are combined using a neural network and arithmetic coded.
There are specialized models for text, binary data, x86 executable code, BMP, 
TIFF, and JPEG images (except in the paq8hp* series, which are tuned for English text only).

<h4>Projects</h4>

<p>PAQ variants licensed under GPL
have held the <a href=http://mailcom.com/challenge/>Calgary Corpus
Compression Challenge</a> title since Jan. 2004, and the
<a href=http://prize.hutter1.net/>Hutter Prize</a> since its inception in
Aug. 2006.

<p><a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/powerpaq>PowerPAQ</a> is
a command line and GUI front end for 32 and 64 bit Linux by Eugene Varnavsky.

<p><a href=http://www.peazip.org/>PeaZip</a> (Giorgio Tani) is a GUI front end
for Windows and Linux that supports the paq8o, lpaq1, and
many other compression formats.

<p><a href=http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/archivers/paq/>FreeBSD port</a>,
usually a few days behind the latest version.

<h4>History</h4>

<p>History prior to March 2007 can be found on the
<a href=paq.html>PAQ history page</a>.

<p><a href=paq8l.zip>paq8l</a> was released Mar. 8 2007 by Matt Mahoney.

<p><a href=paq8hp12any_src.zip>paq8hp12any</a> (May 20 2007, Alexander Rhatushnyak,
updated Jan. 9, 2009) is
a specialized version which has won the 
<a href=http://prize.hutter1.net/>Hutter Prize</a>.  It compresses English text
better and faster than paq8l, but compresses binary data, images, etc. worse.
It includes some dictionary files, which must be in the current directory when run.
It does not compress or create directories or have a drag-and-drop interface.

dictionary-based compression</i></a>, Software - Practice & Experience, 35 (15), 
pp. 1455-1476, December 2005.

<p><a href=paq8fthis2.zip>paq8fthis2</a> (Jan Ondrus, Aug 12 2007),
is based on <a href=paq8f.zip>paq8f</a> (Matt Mahoney, Feb 28 2006) with
improved JPEG compression.

<p><a href=paq8n.zip>paq8n</a> (Matt Mahoney, Aug. 18, 2007)
was created by inserting
the JPEG model from paq8fthis2 into paq8l.

<p><a href=paq8o.zip>paq8o</a> (Andreas Morphis, Aug. 22 2007) 
is derived from paq8n modified with an improved BMP
model.  

<pre>
                 <a href=http://www.maximumcompression.com/data/bmp.php>rafale.bmp</a>  Time  <a href=lena.bmp>lena.bmp</a>  Time
                 ----------  ----  --------  ----
  Original size  4,149,414         786,486
  paq8n -5         634,547    66   419,735    17
  paq8o -5         551,665    78   410,644    21
  paq8osse -5      551,665    72   410,644    20
</pre>

Compression and decompression times are about the same.  Times
are timer 3.01 process times in seconds on a 2.2 GHz Athlon-64 3500+,
2 GB, WinXP SP2, 32 bit.  Other data compresses the same in paq8n and paq8o.

<p>paq8osse is included in the paq8o distribution.  It is for processors
supporting SSE2 such as the Pentium 4 and Athlon.  It is compatible with paq8o2
but 8% faster.

<p><a href=paq8o2.zip>paq8o ver. 2</a> by Andreas Morphis, Aug. 24, 2007,
is a minor bug fix to paq8o to fix the archive file name extension.

<p><a href=paq8fthis3.zip>paq8fthis3</a> by
by Jan Ondrus (Sept. 8, 2007) improves the JPEG model of paq8fthis2.

<p><a href=paq8o3.zip>paq8o3</a> (KZ, Sept. 11, 2007) combines
paq8o ver. 2 with the improved JPEG model from paq8fthis3 and the grayscale
image PGM model introduced in
<a href=paq8i.zip>paq8i</a> by Pavel L. Holoborodko (Aug. 18, 2006),
but not included in later PAQ versions until now.

<p><a href=http://code.google.com/p/paq8/source>paq8o4 ver 1</a>
(KZ, Sept. 15, 2007) extends the PGM model of paq8o3 to 8 bit
grayscale and paletted color BMP files.

<p><a href=paq8o4v2.zip>paq8o4 ver. 2</a>,
released Sept. 17, 2007 by Matt Mahoney, is archive compatible with paq8o4 ver 1.
It fixes directory creation and traversal and wildcard arguments, but is
8% slower because it was compiled with g++ instead of Intel C++.

<p><a href=paq8o5.zip>paq8o5</a> by KZ, Sept. 21, 2007,
is paq8o4v2 with the improved StateMap from lpaq1.

<p><a href=paq8fthis4.zip>paq8fthis4</a> by Jan Ondrus, Sept. 27, 2007,
is paq8f with an improved JPEG model (better than paq8o4/paq8o5).
The archive also includes a faster JPEG model with less compression (paq8fthis_fast).

<p><a href=http://code.google.com/p/paq8/source>paq8o6</a>
<a href=paq8o6.zip>(mirror)</a> by KZ, Sept. 28, 2007,
improves on paq8o5 with the new JPEG model from
paq8fthis4 and some code optimizations by Enrico Zeidler.

<p><a href=paq8o7.zip>paq8o7</a> by KZ, Oct. 16, 2007,
detects 4, 8 and 24 bit BMP, 8 bit PGM images, and has some improvements
to the JPEG model.

<p><a href=paq8o8.zip>paq8o8</a> by KZ, Oct. 23, 2007,
improves JPEG compression further.

<p><a href=http://code.google.com/p/paq8/source/browse/trunk/>paq8o9</a>
(<a href=paq8o9.zip>mirror</a>)
by KZ, Feb. 16, 2007.  Fixes a bug in .bmp detection that caused
an infinite loop for files with invalid headers.  Added grayscale .rgb
support.  Note: paq8o9 bug was fixed by KZ on Mar. 4, 2008.  Mirror
was updated on Mar. 9, 2008.  No version number change.

<p><a href=paq8o10t.zip>paq8o10t</a> is by KZ, June 11, 2008.
Compression is better than paq8o9 on some files but worse on others.
<a href=http://www.encode.ru/forum/showthread.php?t=81>Discussion</a>.

<p><a href=paq8p.zip>paq8p</a> by Andreas Morphis, released Aug. 25, 2008,
has greatly improved .wav compression and slightly improved .bmp compression.
<a href=http://www.encode.ru/forum/showthread.php?t=157>Discussion</a>.
Note: the SSE2 compiled
version is not always archive compatible with the MMX version
(noted by Rugxulo, Mar. 9, 2009).

<p><a href=http://code.google.com/p/paq8/>here</a>. paq8p1 (Oct. 8, 2008)
by Kaidorav fixes some bugs in paq8p.

<p><a href=paq8p.zip>paq8p</a> update: Jan 8, 2009.
Added paq8o8sse2.asm (optimized assembler by
Dark Shikari) and corresponding Windows Pentium 4+ compiled executable,
paq8p_sse2.exe. It is archive compatible with paq8p.exe and
might or might not be faster.

<p><a href=http://www.encode.ru/forum/showthread.php?t=284>paq8p2</a>
by Jan Ondrus, Mar. 2, 2009. Has some improvements in JPEG compression.

<p><a href=http://sites.google.com/site/rugxulo/>paq8o8z</a>
by Rugxulo, Jan.13, 2010, contains ports to several different operating
systems (DOS, Windows (paq8o8zw.exe), OS/2, Linux 2.4 and 2.6, Sun, etc)
and assembly languages. It contains
run time CPU detection to select between SSE2, MMX or non vectorized x86
code appropriately. Will decompress paq8o8 archives.
Replaces versions released Dec. 25, 2008,
Feb. 28, 2009, Apr. 1, 2009, and Apr. 25, 2009. Based on paq8o8.

<p>As of May 30, 2009, the latest version is paq8px_v40, with several new
versions per day. See
<a href=http://www.encode.ru/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=2>encode.ru</a> for
discussion.

<p>As of Apr. 18, 2013, the latest version is
<a href=http://encode.ru/threads/1464-Paq8pxd-dict?p=32898&viewfull=1#post32898>
paq8pxd_v5</a>.

<a name=paq9a>
<h3>PAQ9A</h3>

<p><a href=paq9a.zip>paq9a</a>,
Dec. 31, 2007, is an experimental archiver with compression
and speed similar to lpaq1 and lacking specialized models.  It has a
different architecture than paq8.  It uses LZP preprocessing to speed
compression of highly redundant files, although it is slower than lpaq1
on other files.  It also uses chains of 2-input mixers rather than a
single mixer combining many predictions.

<p>The archive format and command line interface are like lpq1.  The
archive supports files over 2 GB.
<pre>
  To compress:   paq9a a archive [-1..-9] [[-s|-c] files...]...
  To decompress: paq9a x archive [new filenames...]
  List contents: paq9a l archive
</pre>

Options:
<pre>
  -c compress remaining files (default)
  -s store remaining files
  -1..-9 select memory usage from 18 MB to 1585 MB, default -7 = 405 MB.
         Memory usage is about 12 + 3*2<sup>level</sup> MB.  Memory
         option must appear first, e.g.

  paq9a a files.paq9a -4 file1 -s file2 -c file3 file4
</pre>
compresses file1, stores file2, and compresses file3 and file4,
creating archive files.paq9a.  File names are stored exactly as
entered (with or without a path).  Wildcards are allowed if compiled
with g++.  Archives are solid and cannot be
updated once created.  Files can be renamed when extracted:
<pre>
  paq9a x files.paq9a foo bar
</pre>
extracts file1 to foo, file2 to bar, then file3 and file4 without renaming.
If a file already exists or if the stored filename has a path to a
nonexistent directory, then extraction is skipped.

<a name=lpaq>
<h3>LPAQ</h3>

<p><a href=lpaq1.zip>lpaq1</a> (July 24, 2007) is a "lite" version of PAQ,
faster but with less compression.
It is a single file compressor, not an archiver.
<pre>
  To compress:   lpaq1 5 input output
  To decompress: lpaq1 d input output
</pre>
5 selects 102 MB memory.  Options range from 0 (9 MB) to 9 (1542 MB).
Option N uses 6 + 3*2<sup>N</sup> MB.

<p><a href=lpaq1a.zip>lpaq1a</a> by Matt Mahoney, Dec. 21, 2007.  This
is an experimental program (not a new version) that combines the model
from lpaq1 with the asymmetric binary coder from fpaqb.  It is about 1%
slower than lpaq1, compresses 0.02% larger, and requires an extra 1.25 MB
memory during compression.  The purpose of the program is to demonstrate
an alternative to arithmetic coding with performance that is nearly as good.

<p>I am no longer maintaining this code, but there have been many
compression improvements (below):

<h4>LPAQ History</h4>

<p>The first version of <a href=lpaq1.zip>lpaq1</a> was released by Matt
Mahoney on July 24, 2007.

<p><a href=lpaq1v2.zip>lpaq1 ver. 2</a> (Sept. 19, 2007)
by Alexander Rhatushnyak is archive compatible with lpaq1 with
speed optimizations (6% to 10% faster).

<p><a href=lpaq2.zip>lpaq2</a> (Sept. 20, 2007) by Alexander Rhatushnyak
improves compression, but is not compatible with lpaq1.

<p><a href=lpaq3.zip>lpaq3</a> (Sept. 29, 2007) by Alexander Rhatushnyak
includes a version tuned for large text files (elpaq3), compiled from
the same source code with option -DWIKI.

<p><a href=lpaq3a.zip>lpaq3a</a> (Sept. 30, 2007) by Alexander
Rhatushnyak, has slightly better
compression on some files, but slightly worse on others.
lpaq3a.exe was compiled with Intel C++ instead of g++, which might be
faster on some machines (but is slower on my AMD Athlon-64).  This
archive also contains lpaq3e.exe, which is an Intel compile of
elpaq3 (archive compatible).

<p><a href=lpaq4.zip>lpaq4</a> (Oct. 1, 2007) is by Alexander Rhatushnyak.
lpaq4e is tuned for large text files.

<p><a href=lpaq5.zip>lpaq5</a> (Oct. 16, 2007) by Alexander Rhatushnyak
includes a version for large text files (lpaq5e) with separate
compression and decompression programs (lpaq5e-c.exe and lpaq5e-d.exe)
all produced from the same source code.

<p><a href=lpaq6.zip>lpaq6</a> (Oct. 22, 2007) by Alexander Rhatushnyak
includes a E8E9 filter for better compression of x86 executables.
Compression times below are all about 16 seconds.
<pre>
Compressor  Opt  <a href=http://www.maximumcompression.com/data/exe.php>acrord32.exe</a>  <a href=http://www.maximumcompression.com/data/dll.php>mso97.dll</a>

lpaq6e       9   1,187,698     1,591,053
</pre>

<p><a href=lpaq7.zip>lpaq7</a> by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Oct. 31, 2007.

<p><a href=lpaq8.zip>lpaq8</a> by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Dec. 10, 2007.
Update Feb. 15, 2008: lpaq8.exe and lpaq8e.exe are no longer packed with
Upack 0.399.  This caused false alarms by some virus detectors.  However
the .exe files are now larger (but still under 30 KB). lpaq8e (included)
is a version tuned for large text files.

<p><a href=lpaq9m.zpaq>lpaq9m</a> by Alexander Rhatushnyak, Feb. 20, 2009,
is tuned for the large text benchmark. It includes a dictionary
preprocessor (no source code) and a compressed dictionary.
A large number of earlier versions (lpaq9e through lpaq9l) are omitted.
See the large text benchmark for details.

<p>Note: you will need zpaq to extract the archive. Also, the
executables contained within (DRT.exe and lpaq9m.exe) are compressed
with upack, which compresses better than upx. Some virus detectors
give false alarms on all upack-compressed executables. The programs
are not infected.

<a name=lpq1>
<h3>LPQ1</h3>

<p><a href=lpq1v2.zip>lpq1</a> (Dec. 23, 2007,
v2 updated May 6, 2008, Matt Mahoney)
is an archiver based on lpaq1 with support for files over 2 GB
without any Windows or UNIX/Linux specific code (portable C++).
The commands should be familiar to users of 7zip and rar.
Archives are "solid" and cannot be updated once created.
<pre>
  To create an archive:  lpq1 a archive [options] files...
  To extract:            lpq1 x archive [new names]
  To list contents:      lpq1 l archive
</pre>
Compression options are -c to compress (default) or -s to store.
Options can be mixed with filenames and apply to all files that follow,
overriding previous options, for example:
<pre>
  lpq1 a foo.lpq file1.txt -s file2.txt file3.txt -c file4.txt
</pre>
creates archive foo.lpq, compressing file1.txt and file4.txt
and storing file2.txt and file3.txt without compression.

<p>Files are extrated in the order they are added and can be
renamed during extraction:
<pre>
  lpq1 x foo.lpq newfile1.txt newfile2.txt
</pre>
renames file1.txt to newfile1.txt, file2.txt to newfile2.txt,
then extracts file3.txt and file4.txt without renaming.
Extraction does not clobber files.  If any file already exists
or cannot be created, then it is skipped.  lpq1 does not create
folders.  If a file is saved with a path (not recommended)
and the directory does not exist during extraction, then the file 
is skipped.

<p>Version 2 fixes a bug in <a href=lpq1.zip>version 1</a> that
caused it to fail (file not found) when compressing more than about 50 files.
Archives format is unchanged.

<hr>

<a name=bbb>
<h3>BBB</h3>

<p><a href=bbb.zip>bbb</a> (Aug. 31, 2006)
is a Big Block BWT (Burrows-Wheeler transform)
compressor.  It allows blocks as large as 80% of
available memory, unlike other BWT compressors (bzip2, GRZipII, sbc, dark, nanozip, etc),
which allow only 20%.  This allows better compression of very large text files.
However, it lacks a mechanism for handling slow sorting of
long repeating strings, so it can be slow on highly compressible data.
<pre>
  To compress/decompress: bbb cmd input output
</pre>
The command is a sequence of concatenated letters:
<pre>
  c = compress (default),  d = decompress.
  f = fast mode, needs 5x block size memory, default uses 1.25x block size.
  q = quiet (no output except error messages).
  bN, kN, mN = use block size N bytes, KiB, MiB, default = m4 (compression only).
</pre>
Commands should be concatenated in any order, e.g. <tt>bbb cfm100q foo foo.bbb</tt>
means compress foo to foo.bbb in fast mode using 100 MiB block size in quiet
mode.

<p>bbb uses a memory efficient BWT.  For compression, blocks are first context-sorted
in small blocks and then merged using temporary files.  For the inverse transform,
instead of building a linked list, the program builds an index to the approximate location
of the next node, then searches linearly for the exact location.  Fast mode (f) uses
a normal BWT, but requires blocks no larger than 20% of memory.  Fast/slow mode
does not affect the compressed file format and is
independent for compression and decompression.
In either case, the context-sorted block is compressed with an adaptive
order-0 model and arithmetic coded.

<hr>

<a name=sr2>
<h3>SR2</h3>

<p><a href=sr2.zip>sr2</a> (Aug. 3, 2007) is a symbol ranking compressor
designed for high speed rather than good
compression.  It is a single file compressor and uses 6 MB memory.
It models the last 3 bytes seen in the order-4 context by order of appearance,

<h4>History</h4>

<p><a href=sr2.zip>sr2</a> by Matt Mahoney, Aug. 3, 2007.

<p><a href=sr3.zip>sr3</a> modified by Nania Francesco Antonio, Oct. 28, 2007.
Better compression, a little slower, recognizes some file types.  There is
only one program (no unsr2).

<p><a href=sr3a.zip>sr3a</a> modified by Andrew Paterson, Feb. 22, 2008,
is about 5% faster than sr3 and compresses 3 bytes smaller.  It will
also compress and decompress in SR2 and SR3 formats.

<h3>FLZP</h3>

<p><a href=flzp.zip>flzp</a> (June 18, 2008)
is a fast byte-oriented LZP compressor.  It can be used
as a preprocessor to improve the compression ratio and speed
of low order compressors, for example:

<pre>
57,366,279 enwik8.flzp          8 sec (2.2 GHz Athlon-64, WinXP Home)
63,391,013 enwik8.fpaq0         36 sec
39,879,072 enwik8.flzp.fpaq0    8+21 sec
36,800,798 enwik8.ppmd-o2
30,884,687 enwik8.flzp.ppmd-o2
30,017,979 enwik8.ppmd-o3
29,372,279 enwik8.flzp.ppmd-o3
</pre>

<p>The program uses 8 MB memory. It compresses by dividing the input
into blocks up to 64KB, then using any unused bytes in the block
to represent LZP match lengths.

<h3>FPAQ</h3>

FPAQ0 is a simple order-0 arithmetic file compressor for stationary
sources (independent bytes with a uniform distribution throughout the file).  
If you want
to build a custom compressor based on your own model, this is a good
place to start.  The code is much smaller, simpler, and faster than the other
PAQ versions.  This model only compresses well where the bytes are
independent and statistics are uniform throughout the file, so you will
probably want to change it.  There are several versions.

on Sept. 3, 2004, posted here Oct. 9, 2004.
<pre>
  To compress:   fpaq0 c input output
  To decompress: fpaq0 d input output
</pre>

<p><a href=fpaq1.cpp>fpaq1.cpp</a> is a 64-bit version that
gets slightly better compression on purely stationary data, but is slower.  It works
like fpaq0 but compressed files are not compatible.
Posted Jan. 10, 2006.

<p><a href=fpaq0b.cpp>fpaq0b.cpp</a> by Fabio Buffoni uses the same model 
as fpaq0 but compresses
as well as fpaq1 on stationary sources using only 32 bit arithmetic.
It uses the coder from paqar/paq6fb which outputs one bit at a time and uses
a carry counter achieving 30 bits precision.  It is faster than fpaq1 but
slower than fpaq0.  Posted Jan. 10, 2006.

<p><a href=fpaq0s.cpp>fpaq0s.cpp</a> by David A. Scott
improves compression and speed over fpaq0b.cpp by coding
8-bit symbols without an explicit EOF bit or length field.
It uses the end of the compressed file to
mark the end of the uncompressed file, saving the O(log(n)) space
normally required to encode the length.  Posted Jan. 16, 2006.

<p><a href=fpaq.zip>fpaq.zip</a> by Nikolay Petrov is an assembly
language implementation of fpaq0.  It maintains archive compatibility
but compresses 37% faster and decompresses 46% faster (on a
2.2 GHz Athlon-64 in 32 bit mode, XP home).  Feb. 20, 2006.

<p><a href=fpaq02.zip>fpaq02.zip</a> by David Anderson, May 27, 2007.
It is a 64 bit version like fpaq1, but extended using the techniques
of fpaq0s to exact rational representation of probabilities to 64 bits
rather than 12 bits.  The result is a tiny improvement in compression
(a few bytes per million) but about 2.5 times slower than fpaq1.

<p><a href=http://www.encode.ru/downloads/fpaq0p.zip>fpaq0p.zip</a>
by Ilia Muraviev, Apr. 15, 2007, uses an adaptive order 0 model. 
Instead of keeping a 0,1 count for each context, it keeps a probability and updates 
it by adjusting by 1/32 of the error. This is faster because it avoids a division instruction.

<p><a href=fpaqa.zip>fpaqa</a> by Matt Mahoney, Dec. 15, 2007, is
an adaptive order 0 model like fpaq0p, but is based on Jarek Duda's
asymmetric binary coder (ABC) instead of an arithmetic coder.  The coder
has only one state variable (10-12 bits) so can be implemented using
lookup tables without using multiplication.  This is the first
compressor to implement this coder.

<p><a href=fpaqb.zip>fpaqb</a> by Matt Mahoney, Dec. 18, 2007,
updated Dec. 20, 2007,
is an improved ABC coder using bytewise I/O and no tables for
decompression.  It uses one table for compression to avoid division.
It has improved compression (near the theoretical limit) and faster
decompression.  It also uses less memory.

<p><a href=fpaqc.zip>fpaqc</a> by Matt Mahoney, Dec. 24, 2007
(documentation updated Dec. 25, 2007),
is mainly a speed-optimized version of fpaqb.  It also eliminates
block size information from block headers, saving 3 bytes.

<p><a href=fpaq0f.zip>fpaq0f</a> by Matt Mahoney, Jan. 28, 2007
uses the bit history in each bitwise context as context, followed
by arithmetic coding.

<p><a href=fpaq0f2.zip>fpaq0f2</a> by Matt Mahoney, Jan. 30, 2007
modifies fpaq0f by using a simplified bit history consisting of the
last 8 bits, plus some minor improvements.

<p><a href=http://www.fantascienza.net/leonardo/so/fpaq0.zip>D translation</a>
of fpaq0
by Leonardo Maffi was posted Feb. 8, 2008.  The DMD compile is about
60% as fast as g++ -O3.

<h2>Benchmarks</h2>

<p>The benchmarks below are for <a href=calgary.tar.zip>calgary.tar</a>,
the 14 files of the Calgary corpus as a tar file, and for 
enwik8, a 100 MB text file used in the
<a href=text.html>Large Text Compression Benchmark</a> and
<a href=http://prize.hutter1.net/>Hutter Prize</a>.
Compression and decompression times are for enwik8 in seconds on a 2.2 GHz
Athlon-64 3500+ in 32-bit Windows XP.  Memory is in MB.  Options are selected
for maximum compression with 2 GB memory (except paq8f with 1 GB) on enwik8.
All of the high memory compressors have options to select less memory
at the cost of some compression.

<p>As of 2009, timing results are tested on a Gateway M-7301U
laptop with 2.0 GHz dual core Pentium T3200 (1MB L2 cache), 3 GB RAM,
Vista SP1, 32 bit. Run times (on one core) are similar to my older computer.

<a href=jpg2dct.zip>jpg2dct</a> is a JPEG preprocessor by Jean-Pierre Demailly,
Sept. 4, 2007 (ported from Linux to Windows by Matt Mahoney, Sept. 15, 2007).
It expands a JPEG file into DCT coefficients, which makes it larger but
sometimes more compressible to other compressors.  It is lossy in that the inverse transform
does not restore exactly the same file, although it does restore a pixel for pixel identical
image.

<a name=sharnd>
<h3>Incompressible Data?</h3>

SHARND generates cryptographically secure pseudo random files (I think.
I am looking for feedback).
These should not be compressible by any algorithm that does not know
the key used to generate it.  To use:
<pre>
  sharnd key n
</pre>
to generate the n-byte random file, sharnd.out.  The key can be any
ASCII string (quoted if it contains spaces).
Data is generated as a series of 20-byte strings, x[1], x[2], x[3]...
such that x[i] = SHA1(x[i-1] + key), and x[0] = 0.

<p><a href=sharnd.c>sharnd.c</a>, June 7, 2004<br>
<a href=sha1.c>sha1.c</a> from RFC 3174<br>
<a href=sha1.h>sha1.h</a> from RFC 3174<br>
<a href=sharnd.exe>sharnd.exe</a>, 29,860 bytes (16 bit Windows executable, compiled with g++, UPX)<br>
<a href=sharnd.32.exe>sharnd.32.exe</a>, 27,220 bytes (32 bit Windows executable)<br>
<a href=sharnd.64.exe>sharnd.64.exe</a>, 68,096 bytes (64 bit Windows executable)<br>

<p>The 100,000 byte file
<a href=sharnd_challenge.dat>sharnd_challenge.dat</a> posted on June 21, 2004
was generated by sharnd using a secret key.  The SHARND challenge is
to guess either the key (an ASCII string less than 80 bytes) or any of the bytes following
the data.

<p>Furthermore, without knowing the key,
it is believed to be impossible to compress this file, i.e. to find a decompression
program such that its size (as source code or executable) plus the size of its input
is 99,999 bytes or less.  (Of course, such a program does exist.  It is posted here,
and its input is less than 80 bytes).

<h3>BARF - Ultimate Compression?</h3>

Compress <i>any</i> nonempty file.  Recursively compress
files to arbitrarily small sizes. Compress the Calgary corpus
to 1 byte per file in under 1 second.  Is it possible with the
<a href=barf.html>Better Archiver with Recursive Functionality?</a> :-)
